## 2.2 Introduction to the C++ language

### C++ Main()

In C++, every program contains a `main ` function which is executed automatically when the program is run. Every part of a C++ program is run directly or indirectly from `main `, and the most basic program that will compile in C++ is just a `main `function with nothing else.

`main() ` should return an integer (an `int ` in C++), which indicates if the program exited successfully. This is specified in code by writing the return type, followed by the `main ` function name, followed by empty arguments:

```
int main()
```

The body of the `main() `, which comes after the `main  `function name and arguments, is enclosed in curly brackets: `{ `and `} `. In this exercise, you will write the smallest possible C++ program, which is a `main `function with empty body. If you have trouble, have a look at the `solution.cpp ` file in the workspace below.

Remember that you can compile and run your program with the following:

1. To compile, use the following command: `g++ main.cpp`
2. To run, use: `./a.out`

补充：
使用 g++ 编译 C++ 11 标准的 C++ 代码
```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
```

#### To Complete This Exercise

Write a main function in the `main.cpp ` file below, and then compile and run the program. The program will not have any output, but it should compile and run without errors.

Solution:

```cpp
int main() {

}
```



### Compiled Languages vs Scripted Languages

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Compiled Languages

> Your Friend The Compiler What Are The Adv And Disadv Of A Compiled Language Like C

If you want to build. Software. That is stable and as close to error free if you can get it. The compiler is your best friend. Because The compiler is a program that checks that you have followed your own rules and the languages rule even one that's very tedious and difficult with a dynamically checked language, you have to rely on having completely tested your program and that never happens.

#### Advantages of a Dynamically Scripted Language

> When Not To Use C++ What Are The Advantages Of A Dynamically Scripted Language

The advantage of a dynamic language is exactly the mirror image of the advantage of a compiled language. You can get to run quickly and you can run or kinds of things, even if they are completely correct if they are not completely correct, so say if you're doing a series of experiments with some data. Generate some data display it generate data change the algorithm run it with a smaller data set. It doesn't matter if it's 10 times or 50 times slower, but it is really nice that you don't have to go through the compiler step and wait. 30 seconds or half an hour to get the optimal code completely checked, so if you're doing sort of interactive experimental stuff at dynamically check language. Javascript or Python or something like that has an obvious and simple advantage on the other hand, implement something like JavaScript. You want to write a JavaScript engine or do you write it in C plus plus? Course. So you don't actually ever use a system that only uses one language that for big systems that that that time went 30 or 40 years ago, you use combinations of languages? And professionals know more than one language, so they can pick the right one for the task 10 is getting hard, but you know as you get older, you pick them up anyway. But let's start out with with 3 to 5 and then you may feel that you can do something.

### C++ Output and Language Basics

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello!" << "\n";
}
```



```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

- The #include is a preprocessor command which is executed before the code is compiled. It searches for the iostream header file and pastes its contents into the program. iostream contains the declarations for the input/output stream objects.

```cpp
using std::cout;
```

- Namespaces are a way in C++ to group identifiers (names) together. They provide context for identifiers to avoid naming collisions. The std namespace is the namespace used for the standard library.
- The using command adds `std::cout` to the global scope of the program. This way you can use cout in your code instead of having to write `std::cout`.
- `cout` is an output stream you will use to send output to the notebook or to a terminal, if you are using one.
- Note that the second two lines in the example end with a semicolon `;`. Coding statements end with a semicolon in C++. The `#include` statement is a preprocessor command, so it doesn't need one.

```cpp
cout << "Hello!" << "\n";
```

- In this line, the code is using cout to send output to the notebook. The `<<` operator is the stream insertion operator, and it writes what's on the right side of the operator to the left side. So in this case, "Message here" is written to the output stream cout.



### Primitive Variable Types

Primitive types

C++ has several "primitive" variable types, which are things like ints (integers), strings, floats, and others. These should be similar to variable types in other programming languages you have used.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    // Declaring and initializing an int variable.
    int a = 9;
    
    // Declaring a string variable without initializing right away.
    std::string b;
    
    // Initializing the string b.
    b = "Here is a string";
    
    cout << a << "\n";
    cout << b << "\n";
}
```



### C++ Vectors

Vector Containers

- 1D Vectors

C++ also has several container types that can be used for storing data. We will start with vectors, as these will be used throughout this lesson, but we will also introduce other container types as needed.

Vectors are a sequence of elements of a single type, and have useful methods for getting the size, testing if the vector is empty, and adding elements to the vector.

- 2D Vectors

Unfortunately, there isn't a built-in way to print vectors in C++ using cout. You will learn how to access vector elements and you will write your own function to print vectors later. For now, you can see how vectors are created and stored. Below, you can see how to nest vectors to create 2D containers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::cout;
using std::vector;

int main(){

    //1d
    vector<int> v1{0,1,2};
    vector<int> v2 = {3,4,5};
    vector<int> v3;
    v3 = {6,7,8};
    cout << "1d initial ok"<<"\n";
    cout << v1[2] << "\n";
    cout << v2[0] << "\n";
    cout << v3[1] << "\n";

    //2d
    vector<vector<int>> v2d {{1,2},{7,8}};
    cout << "2d initial ok"<<"\n";
    cout << v2d[1][1] << "\n";

}
```



补充：

[vector - C++ Reference (cplusplus.com)](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/)

在C++11中，使用 `{}` 可进行如下各项的初始化：

- 类成员快速初始化
- 数组、集合（列表）初始化
- 自定义类型初始化

C++11可以将 `{}` 初始化器用于任何类型（可以使用等号，也可以不适用），这是一种通用的初始化语法。



### C++ Comments

C++ provides two kinds of comments:

```cpp
// You can use two forward slashes for single line comments.

/*
For longer comments, you can enclose the text with an opening
slash-star and closing star-slash.
*/ 
```



### Using Auto

In your previous code, the type for each variable was explicitly declared.

In general, this is not necessary, and the compiler can determine the type based on the value being assigned.

To have the type automatically determined, use the `auto` keyword. You can test this by executing the cell below:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
using std::cout;

int main() {
    auto i = 5;
    auto v_6 = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9};
    cout << "Variables declared and initialized without explicitly stating type!" << "\n";

    for (auto i : v_6){
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
}
```

It is helpful to manually declare the type of a variable if you want the variable type to be clear for reader of your code, or if you want to be explicit about the number precision being used; C++ has several number types with different levels of precision, and this precision might not be clear from the value being assigned.

### Store a Grid in Your Program

In order to write the A* search algorithm, you will need a grid or "board" to search through. We'll be working with this board throughout the remaining exercises, and we'll start by storing a hard-coded board in the main function. In later exercises, you will write code to read the board from a file.



#### To Complete This Exercise

1. In the `main `function, declare a variable `board `as a vector of vectors of ints: `vector<vector<int>> `.

2. Assign this data to the board variable:

```
{{0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
 {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
 {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
 {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
 {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0}}
```

**Note:** you will need to include the `vector ` library, just as  `iostream ` is included. You will also need to use the namespace `std::vector ` if you want to write `vector ` rather than `std::vector ` in your code.

Solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::vector;

int main() {
  vector<vector<int>> broad = {{0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                               {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                               {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                               {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                               {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0}};
}
```



### Working with Vectors

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
using std::cout;

int main() {

    //////////////////////
    //1D Vector Access
    /////////////////////
    vector<int> a = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    cout << a[0];
    cout << a[1];
    cout << a[2];
    cout << "\n";
    //Getting a Vector's Length
    cout << a.size() << "\n";

    ////////////////////////
    //2D Vector Access
    ///////////////////////
    vector<vector<int>> b = {{1, 1, 2, 3},
                             {2, 1, 2, 3},
                             {3, 1, 2, 3}};

    cout << b[2][1];
    cout << "\n";
    //Getting a Vector's Length
    cout << b.size() << "x" << b[0].size() << "\n";

}
```



### For Loops

Just as in other languages you've worked with, C++ has both `for ` loops and `while ` loops. You will learn about `for ` loops in the notebook below, and you will see `while ` loops later in the course.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::cout;
using std::vector;

int main() {
    /* For Loop with an Index Variable */
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << i << "\n";
    }

    /* The Increment Operator */
    auto i = 1;

    // Post-increment assigns i to c and then increments i.
    auto c = i++;

    cout << "Post-increment example:" << "\n";
    cout << "The value of c is: " << c << "\n";
    cout << "The value of i is: " << i << "\n";
    cout << "\n";

    // Reset i to 1.
    i = 1;

    // Pre-increment increments i, then assigns to c.
    c = ++i;

    cout << "Pre-increment example:" << "\n";
    cout << "The value of c is: " << c << "\n";
    cout << "The value of i is: " << i << "\n";
    cout << "\n";

    // Decrement i;
    i--;
    cout << "Decrement example:" << "\n";
    cout << "The value of i is: " << i << "\n";

    /* For Loop with a Container */
    // C++ offers several ways to iterate over containers. 
    // One way is to use an index-based loop as above. 
    // Another way is using a "range-based loop", which you will see frequently in the rest of this course.
    vector<int> a {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int i : a) {
        cout << i << "\n";
    }
}
```



### Functions

When a function is declared and defined in a single C++ file, the basic syntax is as follows:

```cpp
return_type FunctionName(parameter_list) {
  // Body of function here.
}
```

#### AdditionFunction

```cpp
// AdditionFunction.cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

// Function declared and defined here.
int AdditionFunction(int i, int j) 
{
    return i + j;
}

int main() 
{
    auto d = 3;
    auto f = 7;
    cout << AdditionFunction(d, f) << "\n";
}
```

#### PrintStrings

```cpp
// PrintStrings.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using std::cout;
using std::string;

// Write the PrintStrings function here.
void PrintStrings(string a, string b)
{
    cout << a << " " << b << "\n";
}


int main() 
{
    string s1 = "C++ is";
    string s2 = "super awesome.";
    
    // Uncomment the following line to call your function:
    PrintStrings(s1, s2);
}
```



#### VectorAddition

```cpp
// VectorAddition.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::cout;
using std::vector;

// Define a function "AdditionFunction" here.
// Instead of just two ints, this function should accept a vector<int> 
// as the argument, and it should return the sum of all the ints in the vector.

int AdditionFunction(vector<int> v) 
{
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : v) 
    {
        sum += num;
    }

    return sum;
}

int main() 
{
    vector<int> v {1, 2, 3};
    
    // Uncomment the following line to call your function:
    cout << AdditionFunction(v) << "\n";
}
```



### Print the Board

Now that you have a board stored in your program, you'll need a way to print it out so you can display the results of your project. In this exercise, you will add a `PrintBoard ` function to print the board one row at a time. When you are done, the printed output should look like:

```
010000
010000
010000
010000
000010
```

#### To Complete This Exercise

- Write a `void PrintBoard ` function. The function should accept the board as an argument. The function should print each row of the board with a newline `"\n" `.

- When you have written your `PrintBoard  `function, call it from within `main() ` to print the board.

Solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
using std::cout;

void PrintBoard(vector<vector<int>> board) {
  for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
      cout << board[i][j];
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<vector<int>> board = {{0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                               {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                               {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                               {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                               {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0}};
  PrintBoard(board);
}
```



### If Statements and While Loops

C++ if statements work very similarly to if statements in other languages. In C++, the boolean condition is contained in parentheses `(` and `)`, and the body of the statement is enclosed in curly brackets `{` and `}`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    // Set a equal to true here.
    bool a = true;

    if (a) {
      cout << "Hooray! You made it into the if statement!" << "\n";
    }
}
```



The syntax for a while loop looks very similar to the syntax for the if statement.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() 
{
    auto i = 0;

    while (i < 5) {
      cout << i << "\n";
      i++;
    }
}
```



Practice

In the following code cell, you will combine a while loop with an if statement to print every other number. Write a while loop to iterate over the integers from 1 to 10. If the integer is even, print it out.

Hint: you can tell if an integer is even by looking at its remainder after dividing by two. In C++, the remainder operator is `%`. In other words, for a given `int i`, you have `remainder = i % 2`. If remainder equals 0, the number is even.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int i = 1; 
  while (i <= 10) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      std::cout << i << "\n";
    }
    i++;
  }
}
```





### Reading from a File

Four steps to reading a file:

1. `#include <fstream>` .

2. Create a `std::ifstream object` using the path to your file.
3. Evaluate the `std::ifstream object` as a bool to ensure that the stream creation did not fail.
4. Use a while loop with getline to write file lines to a string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

//add this for file
#include <fstream>

void file_open_testing(){
    //initial a fstream object
    //std::fstream my_file;
    //my_file.open(path)

    //or initial in one line
    //std::ifstream my_file(path);
    std::fstream my_file;
    my_file.open("udacity_c++/L2_introduction_c++/20_Reading_From_a_File/files/1.board");

    //this instance my_file can use as boolean to check is the file exist or not
    if (my_file) {
        std::cout << "we have this file" << "\n";
    }
  	else {
        std::cout << "we DON'T have this file" << "\n";
    }
}


void reading_data_from_stream(){
    std::fstream my_file("udacity_c++/L2_introduction_c++/20_Reading_From_a_File/files/1.board");
    if(my_file){
        std::cout << "The file stream has been created!" << "\n";
        std::string line;
        while (getline(my_file, line)){
            std::cout << line << "\n";
        }
    }
}


int main(){
    file_open_testing();
    reading_data_from_stream();
}
```



Until now, the board has been declared and initialized in the `main() ` function. As discussed in the previous notebook, you will need a function to read the board in from another file in order to make the program a little more flexible and user-friendly.

The first step in this process will be to write a `ReadBoardFile ` function that reads in the file and prints each line to `cout `. The output should look like the `1.board ` file, which can be opened in the editor below:

```
0,1,0,0,0,0,
0,1,0,0,0,0,
0,1,0,0,0,0,
0,1,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0,0,1,0,
```

#### To Complete This Exercise

1. Write a function `void ReadBoardFile ` which reads lines from a file. Write each line to `cout ` , followed by a newline character `"\n" `. The function should accept a string argument, which represents the path to the file. For now, since `ReadBoardFile ` does not need to return anything, you can use a `void ` return type.
2. Call `ReadBoardFile ` from main using the argument `"1.board" `.

**Note:** you will need to include the `fstream ` class, and you may want to have `using std::ifstream ` to use the `ifstream ` object without having to write `std:: ` in the rest of your code.

Solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>


void ReadBroadFile(std::string file_path) {
    std::fstream board_file(file_path);
    if (board_file) {
        std::string line;
        // Read file
        while (getline(board_file, line)) {
            std::cout << line << "\n";
        }
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "no such file " << file_path << "\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    // TODO: Call the ReadBoardFile function here.
    std::string file_path = "udacity_c++/L2_introduction_c++/21_Read_the_Board_from_a_File/files/1.board";
    ReadBroadFile(file_path);
}
```

Output:

```
0,1,0,0,0,0,
0,1,0,0,0,0,
0,1,0,0,0,0,
0,1,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0,0,1,0,
```



### Processing Strings

Now that the board is being read into your program line by line, you will want to process each line and store the data, rather than just streaming it to `cout `. There are many ways to do this in C++, but we will focus on `istringstream ` from the `<sstream> ` header file.

Streaming ints from a string with istringstream:

In C++ strings can be streamed into temporary variables, similarly to how files can be streamed into strings. Streaming a string allows us to work with each character individually. 

One way to stream a string is to use an input string stream object istringstream from the `<sstream>` header. Once an istringstream object has been created, parts of the string can be streamed and stored using the "extraction operator": `>>`. The extraction operator will read until whitespace is reached or until the stream fails. 

Execute the following code to see how this works:

Read int from file string

1. `#include<sstream>`
2. `using std::istringstream` can read string and stop only hit space or error(end)

istringstream 的作用是从 string 对象中读取字符，通过空格（或回车）来分割字符串输入。

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

using std::cout;
using std::string;
using std::istringstream;

int main(){
    //stream with all INT type
    istringstream_test();
    use_isstringstream_as_boolen_read_all();
    common_way_to_use_istringstream_in_while();

    //stream with MIX type
    //the INT spreated by only one char not space
    string_with_MIX_types_not_space();
}
```

#### myreader

myreader is a pointer, which point to the contain of string. if the current pointer READ (`>>`) the non-number or error or end of file, the myreader will return error or 0 or false. every time you extract a contain, the myrerader will move right to next contain.

```cpp
void istringstream_test(){
    cout << __func__<< "\n";

    string a("1 2 3");

    istringstream my_stream(a);

    int n;
    my_stream >> n; 
  	// The extraction operator will read until whitespace is reached or until the stream fails. 
    cout << n << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
istringstream_test
1
```

#### use isstringstream as boolen read all

```cpp
void use_isstringstream_as_boolen_read_all(){
    cout << __func__<< "\n";

    string a("1 2 3");

    istringstream my_stream(a);

    int n;
    
    // Testing to see if the stream was successful and printing results.
    while (my_stream) {
        my_stream >> n;
        if (my_stream) {
            cout << "That stream was successful: " << n << "\n";
        }
        else {
            cout << "That stream was NOT successful!" << "\n";            
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```cpp
use_isstringstream_as_boolen_read_all
That stream was successful: 1
That stream was successful: 2
That stream was successful: 3
That stream was NOT successful!
```



#### common way to use istringstream in while

```cpp
void common_way_to_use_istringstream_in_while(){
    cout << __func__<< "\n";

    istringstream myreader("1 2 3");
    int n;
    while(myreader >> n){
        cout << "read: " << n << "\n";
    }
    cout << "The stream has failed or ended." << "\n";
}
```

Output: 

```cpp
common_way_to_use_istringstream_in_while
read: 1
read: 2
read: 3
The stream has failed or ended.
```



#### string with MIX types not space

In the stream example above, the string contained only whitespaces and characters which could be converted to ints. If the string has mixed types, more care is needed to process the string. In the following example, the type char is used, which is a type that can hold only a single ASCII character.

```cpp
void string_with_MIX_types_not_space(){
    cout << __func__<< "\n";

    string b("1,2,3,4,6q7p8o9");

    istringstream mixstring(b);

    //need two type of tmp value
    char c;
    int n;
  
    while(mixstring >> n >> c){
        cout << "read int: "<< n << ", read char: " << c << "\n";
    }
    cout << "The stream has failed or ended." << "\n";
}
```

Notice that the 9 was not printed. `mixstring >> n >> c` tried to stream an int followed by a char. Since there was no char after the 9, the stream failed and the while loop exited.

Output:

```cpp
string_with_MIX_types_not_space
read int: 1, read char: ,
read int: 2, read char: ,
read int: 3, read char: ,
read int: 4, read char: ,
read int: 6, read char: q
read int: 7, read char: p
read int: 8, read char: o
The stream has failed or ended.
```

### Adding Data to a Vector

Vector `push_back` :

Now that you are able to process a string, you may want to store the results of the processing in a convenient container for later use. In the next exercise, you will store the streamed ints from each line of the board in a `vector<int>`. To do this, you will add the ints to the back of the vector, using he vector method `push_back`:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using std::vector;
using std::cout;

/////////////////////
// push_back(data)
/////////////////////
int main() {
    // Initial Vector
    //vector<int> v {1, 2, 3};
    vector v {1, 2, 3}; //works only on c++17 without vector type

    // Print the contents of the vector
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
      cout << v[i] << "\n";
    }

    // Push 4 to the back of the vector
    v.push_back(4);

    // Print the contents again
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
      cout << v[i] << "\n";
    }

}
```



### Parse Lines from the File

Now that you are able to read a board line by line from a file, you will want to parse these lines and store them in a `vector<int> `. In this exercise, you will focus on a helper function to do this string parsing.

#### To Complete This Exercise

Write a `vector<int> ParseLine ` function which accepts a string as an argument. Use `std::istringstream ` to parse the line by comma `char `s, and store the `int `s in a `vector<int> `. `ParseLine ` should return the vector after parsing.

**Note:** you will need to `#include <sstream> ` to use `istringstream `. Additionally, you may want to add `using std::istringstream; ` to your program. Finally, remember that each line of the board will look something like: `1,0,0,0,0, `, so you may want to stream an `int ` and a `char ` with each pass through a `while ` loop.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
using std::cout;
using std::ifstream;
using std::istringstream;
using std::string;
using std::vector;

// TODO: Add the ParseLine function here.
vector<int> ParseLine(string line){
    vector<int> rst;
    istringstream myrerader(line);
    char c;
    int n;
    while(myrerader >> n >> c){
        rst.push_back(n);
    }
    return rst;
}

void PrintVect(const std::vector<int> vect) {
    for (int i = 0; i < vect.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << vect[i] << " ";
    }
}

int main() {
  ReadBoardFile("1.board");
  std::vector<int> v;
  std::string line = "0,1,0,0,0,0,";
  v = ParseLine(line);
  PrintVect(v);
}
```



### Use the ParseLine Function

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
using std::cout;
using std::ifstream;
using std::istringstream;
using std::string;
using std::vector;

vector<int> ParseLine_row(string line) {
    istringstream sline(line);
    int n;
    char c;
    vector<int> row;
    while (sline >> n >> c && c == ',') {
      row.push_back(n);
    }
    return row;
}

// TODO: Change the return type of ReadBoardFile.
vector<vector<int>> ReadBoardFile(string path) {
  ifstream myfile (path);
  // TODO: Declare an empty board variable here with
  // type vector<vector<int>>.
  vector<vector<int>> board;
  if (myfile) {
    string line;
    while (getline(myfile, line)) {
      // TODO: Replace the "cout" code with a call to ParseLine for each line and push the results of ParseLine to the back of the board.
      board.push_back(ParseLine_row(line));
      //cout << line << "\n";
    }
  }
  // TODO: Return the board variable.
  return board;
}

void PrintBoard(const vector<vector<int>> board) {
  for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < board[i].size(); j++) {
      cout << board[i][j];
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  // TODO: Store the output of ReadBoardFile in the "board" variable.
  vector<vector<int>> board;
  board = ReadBoardFile("1.board");
  // TODO: Uncomment PrintBoard below to print "board".
  PrintBoard(board);
}
```

Complete:

```
010000
010000
010000
010000
000010
```



### Use Enums to Format the Printed Board

In the previous exercises, you stored and printed the board as a `vector<vector<int>>` ,where only two states were used for each cell: `0` and `1`. This is a great way to get started, but as the program becomes more complicated, there will be more than two possible states for each cell. Additionally, it would be nice to print the board in a way that clearly indicates open areas and obstacles, just as the board is printed above. To do this clearly in your code, you will learn about and use something called an enum. An enum, short for enumerator, is a way to define a type in C++ with values that are restricted to a fixed range.



#### Enums

C++ allows you to define a custom type which has values limited to a specific range you list or "enumerate". This custom type is called an "enum". Suppose you were writing a program that stores information about each user's car, including the color. You could define a Color enum in your program, with a fixed range of all the acceptable values:

We want to limited the possible colors.

```
white
black
blue
red
```

https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum

scoped enums

```cpp
enum + class/structure + name {items}
```

unscoped enums (only remove the class/sturcture from scoped enums)

```cpp
enum + name {items}
```



```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

void scoped_enum(){
    // Create the enum Color with fixed values.
    // scoped enum
    enum class Color {white,
                      black,
                      blue,
                      red};

    // Create a Color variable and set it to Color::blue.
    Color my_color;
    //assign
    my_color = Color::blue;

    // Test to see if my car is red.
    if (my_color == Color::red) {
        cout << "The color of my car is red!" << "\n";
    } else {
        cout << "The color of my car is not red." << "\n";
    }
}

void unscoped_enum(){

    enum Color {  white =0,
                  black,
                  blue,
                  red};

    Color my_color = blue;
    cout << my_color << "\n";
    // Test to see if my car is red.
    if (my_color == red) {
        cout << "The color of my car is red!" << "\n";
    } else {
        cout << "The color of my car is not red." << "\n";
    }
}

void enum_switch(){

    enum class keypad {up,down,left,right};

    keypad input;
    input = keypad::down;

    switch(input){
        case keypad::up:
            cout<<"up"<<"\n";
            break;
        case keypad::down:
            cout<<"down"<<"\n";
            break;
        case keypad::left:
            cout<<"left"<<"\n";
            break;
        case keypad::right:
            cout<<"right"<<"\n";
            break;
    }
}

int main()
{
    scoped_enum();
    unscoped_enum();
    enum_switch();
}
```



#### Formatting the Printed Board

Before:

```
010000
010000
010000
010000
000010
```

After:

```
0   ⛰️   0   0   0   0

0   ⛰️   0   0   0   0

0   ⛰️   0   0   0   0

0   ⛰️   0   0   0   0

0   0    0   0  ⛰️   0
```



The board will eventually have more than two cell states as the program becomes more complicated, and it would be nice to add formatting to the printed output of the board to ensure readability as the number of board states increases.

To accommodate more board states and facilitate print formatting, we have provided the State enum with enumerator values kEmpty and kObstacle. In this exercise, you will write a CellString function which converts each State to an appropriate string.

In the next exercise, we will update the program to use the enum values and CellString function.

```cpp
// Formatting the Printed Board
enum class State {kEmpty, kObstacle};

string CellString(State cell) {
  switch(cell) {
    case State::kObstacle: return "⛰️   ";
    case State::kEmpty: return "0   ";
    //default: return "0   ";
  }
}
```

#### Store the Board Using the State Enum

Follow the `TODO` comments in the `main ` file below, and update the program to store a board of `State ` variables. When you are done, the board should print as in the image above. Note that you will need to call `CellString ` on each object in the board before printing: `CellString(board[i][j]) `.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using std::cout;
using std::ifstream;
using std::istringstream;
using std::string;
using std::vector;

enum class State {kEmpty, kObstacle};

// TODO: Change the return type to use auto or
// explicitly indicate vector<State>
vector<State> ParseLine(string line) {
    istringstream sline(line);
    int n;
    char c;
    // TODO: Change the variable type for row
    // to be a vector<State>
    vector<State> row;
    State curstate;
    while (sline >> n >> c && c == ',') {
      // TODO: Modify the line below to push_back
      // a State::kEmpty if n is 0, and push_back
      // a State::kObstacle otherwise.
      if (n == 0){
          curstate = State::kEmpty;
      }
      else if(n == 1){
          curstate = State::kObstacle;
      }
      row.push_back(curstate);
    }
    return row;
}

// TODO: Modify the return type here as well. Just
// as above, the board will contain State objects
// instead of ints.
vector<vector<State>> ReadBoardFile(string path) {
  ifstream myfile (path);
  // TODO: Modify the board declarationto store
  // State objects instead of ints.
  vector<vector<State>> board{};
  if (myfile) {
    string line;
    while (getline(myfile, line)) {
      // TODO: Modify the row type to use State
      // objects instead of ints.
      vector<State> row = ParseLine(line);
      board.push_back(row);
    }
  }
  return board;
}

string CellString(State cell) {
  switch(cell) {
    case State::kObstacle: return "⛰️   ";
    case State::kEmpty: return "0   ";
    //default: return "0   ";
  }
}

void PrintBoard(const vector<vector<State>> board) {
  for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < board[i].size(); j++) {
      // TODO: Modify the line below to call CellString
      // on each element of the board before streaming to cout.
      cout << CellString(board[i][j]);
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  auto board = ReadBoardFile("1.board");
  PrintBoard(board);
}
```

Complete:

```
0   ⛰️   0   0   0   0   
0   ⛰️   0   0   0   0   
0   ⛰️   0   0   0   0   
0   ⛰️   0   0   0   0   
0   0   0   0   ⛰️   0    
```
