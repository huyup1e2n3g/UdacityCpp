### Lesson 03: A* Search
> In this lesson, you will learn about the A* search algorithm. Over a sequence of exercises, you will use your A* search implementation to plan a path through the obstacles in the ASCII board.

#### Lesson Outline

- Introduction to Search
  - A* search algorithm
- Program A* Search
  - Algorithm will be broken down into several exercises for you 
  - Algorithm summary and structure of code for exercises
- C++ Features
  - Pass-by-reference
  - const and constexpr
  - Arrays

### Lesson 04: Writing Multifile Programs
> In this lesson, you will learn the syntax for C++ language features that you will need for the next steps in the course. This includes an overview of header files, pointers, build tools, and classes.

#### Lesson Outline
- Header files
  - Using headers to break a single file into multiple files
- Build systems
  - CMake and Make
- Tools for writing larger programs:
  - References
  - Pointers
  - Maps
  - Classes and object-oriented programming in C++
